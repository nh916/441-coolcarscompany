it deviates away from the erd a bit because i think this is a better way and I think
we should update some attributes within erd and relations.
The fk and pk are all the same

differences
    customer does not hold state
    domestic holds state
    international holds country
    got rid of region code and country code for both


    vehicle does not have name instead
        it has brand and model


I think sqlite might treat INTEGER and INT the same but
I am not sure and it works so I left it as that
